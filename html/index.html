        I won’t be in the twilight years of my life leafing through commercial
        headshots, strangers’ weddings or annual reports. I’ll be reliving
        memories from my daughter’s childhood, our family travel. Friends and
        relatives no longer with us. The many happy years of our marriage.
        Everything else is just noise.

        All in all… it is a really well built 127 format film camera and as the
        name “Automatic Rolleiflex 4×4” suggests, it produces 4x4cm frames (the
        so-called Superslide format). If you do decide to try one it would be
        good to budget for a CLA, the shutter on mine was sticking at slower
        speeds when I got it. Plus also, if you don’t wany to fiddle with
        slitting your own 127 and using your old backing paper, the film is
        still out there, but pricey and the pickings are slim.

        I have owned and sold a fair number of these cameras during the last 40
        years, and every time I let them go I am left with This year I got to
        purchase a nice example of a 60’s-built Rolleiflex 3.5E with a 75 mm
        3.5f lens and a busted light meter ,just a minor niggle since I own two
        hand-held meters. I think that I will never cease owning and using these
        magnificent TLRs as long as I live. Shooting square format is quite
        challenging, but I always took forward to the challenge with a
        Rolleiflex in hand.

        My Rolleiflex 2.8C indeed looks, feels and performs like one of
        history’s most iconic cameras, with one of the most revered lenses. If,
        like me, you take a visceral delight in the feel, sound and performance
        of exquisitely made equipment, if you revel in the quirks of a figuring
        out a nearly 70-year-old manual camera, and if you just flat-out think
        it’s the coolest goddamn thing you’ve ever seen in your life, I couldn’t
        recommend it more. I love this camera in a way I love few other
        inanimate objects. I got a pretty good deal on mine—$300 purchase price,
        $140 for some touch-up repair—so keep tracking your preferred online
        marketplaces. You might luck out like I did.
