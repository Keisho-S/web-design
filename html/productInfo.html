        The "Rolleiflex" name is most commonly used to refer to Rollei's premier
        line of medium format twin lens reflex (TLR) cameras. (A companion line
        intended for amateur photographers, Rolleicord, existed for several
        decades.) However, a variety of TLRs and SLRs in medium format, and zone
        focus, and SLR 35 mm, as well as digital formats have also been produced
        under the Rolleiflex label. The 120 roll film Rolleiflex series is
        marketed primarily to professional photographers. Rolleiflex cameras
        have used film formats 117 (Original Rolleiflex), 120 (Standard,
        Automat, Letter Models, Rollei-Magic, and T model), and 127 (Baby
        Rolleiflex).

        The Rolleiflex TLR film cameras were known for their exceptional build
        quality, compact size, modest weight, superior optics, durability,
        simplicity, reliable mechanics and bright viewfinders. The high-quality
        7.5 cm focal length lenses, manufactured by Zeiss and Schneider, allowed
        for a smaller, lighter, more compact camera than their
        imitators.[citation needed] The highly regarded Zeiss Planar f2.8 and
        Schneider Xenotar lenses, both 80mm focal length and fast in comparison,
        are both state of the art optics. Unique to the Rolleiflex Automat and
        letter model cameras, the mechanical wind mechanism was robust and
        clever, making film loading semi-automatic and quick. This mechanism
        started the exposure counter automatically, auto-spaced the 12 or (on
        the later model F cameras) 24 exposures, and tensioned the shutter; all
        with less than one full turn of the film advance crank. This makes the
        Rolleiflex Automat/Letter model cameras very sought-after for shooting
        fast-paced action, such as street photography.

        A range of accessories made this camera a system: panorama head, sun
        shade, parallax-corrected close-ups lenses, color correction, contrast
        enhancing, and special effect filters, all mounted with a quick release
        bayonet, as well as a quick-change tripod attachment. Some,
        professional, amateur and fine-art photographers still shoot Rolleiflex
        TLR film cameras with color transparency, color negative, or
        black-and-white film. The later f2.8 and f3.5 letter models (Planar or
        Xenotar lens) are highly sought after in the used market, and command
        the greatest price.Historically there were five focal length cameras
        available including 5.5 cm Rollei-Wide, 6.0 cm Baby Rollei, 7.5 cm
        (f:3.5), 8.0 cm (f2.8), and 13.5 cm (f:4 Zeiss Sonnar) Tele-Rolleiflex.
        Although all Rolleflex cameras can be fine user cameras, there is also
        an active market for many Rolleiflex models as collectables, and this
        adds (greatly in some models) to the end price paid, particularly in
        Japan.
