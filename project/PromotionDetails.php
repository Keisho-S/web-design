        The first prototype of the new camera, named the Rolleiflex, was finally
        completed in 1927; it was built for absolute reliability and featured a
        rigid, injection-moulded housing made of aluminium. Heidecke wanted to
        avoid conventional leather bellows for focusing the lens because of an
        earlier, bad experience: around 1916, he conducted an experiment with a
        Kodak camera; he left it in a cellar, and when he later retrieved it, he
        found that rats had eaten the bellows. This convinced him that a camera
        designed for photojournalism and operation in the tropics had to work
        perfectly, which excluded components that might rot. He ruled out a
        cloth shutter curtain for the same reason, choosing instead a Compur
        mechanical shutter.

        Focusing in the "Rolleiflex" was achieved by moving the carriage that
        held both the viewfinder and the imaging lens, i.e. the camera had
        so-called "metallic bellows"; that is, the plate enclosed the sides of
        the case. It was crucial that the plate remained parallel as it moved
        during focusing; to achieve this, Heidecke developed an ingenious design
        which proved to be highly successful. Behind the imaging lens and
        surrounding the opening for the optical path was a large cogwheel which
        drove four smaller cogs located top left and right, and bottom left and
        right. Each of the four small cogs drove rack and pinions (toothed
        rails) attached to the lens assembly. This system functioned perfectly,
        and, thanks to high-quality components, also for many years of service.
        Only the viewfinder and back of the camera, both made of aluminium, had
        to be handled with care, which remained the case until the camera went
        into production.

        <img src="img/10.jpg" alt="Rolleiflex on Magazine " id="img10" />One
        more prototype was produced in 1928, and then the big moment finally
        arrived: on August 10, the first camera went into series production.
        Altogether, 14 units were made that year. Then, at 11am on Monday, 11
        December, selected journalists were invited to a press conference in the
        festively decorated production area. Paul Franke put together press
        packs for the occasion, which led one magazine to publish a test report
        without ever actually handling the camera. Although Franke had forgotten
        to prepare sample photographs to distribute to the press, he neatly
        avoided this oversight by distributing empty, labelled cartons around
        the building, just for show.
