        was a German company that established a worldwide reputation with the
        Rolleiflex, a twin-lens reflex camera.

        Rollei was founded in 1920 as the Werkstatt für Feinmechanik und Optik,
        Franke & Heidecke in order to make a twin-lens reflex camera. The
        company changed its name and legal form many times: to Rollei-Werke
        Franke & Heidecke in 1962, to Rollei-Werke Franke & Heidecke GmbH & Co.
        KG in 1979, to Rollei Fototechnic GmbH & Co. KG in 1981, and finally to
        Rollei GmbH in 2004. In 2006, the headquarters of Rollei GmbH were moved
        to Berlin while production was transferred to Rollei Produktion GmbH,
        currently Franke & Heidecke GmbH, in Braunschweig. The company underwent
        more radical restructuring in 2007/08.

        The frequent name-changes are an indication of a turbulent history:
        After the popularity of the twin lens reflex cameras declined, the
        Rolleiflex was supplemented with a variety of models. The company
        expanded its production facilities and product range at the end of the
        1960s beyond what a small company like Rollei could manage. Rollei's
        decision to start manufacturing in Singapore in 1970 was regarded as a
        pioneering achievement by the photographic industry. Unfortunately, it
        also damaged the companies reputation as a German precision
        manufacturer. In 1982, after many failed attempts at restructuring, the
        company finally achieved success by focusing on medium format cameras
        along with a few other products. Surveying systems were added to the
        product range in 1986, and modern digital and compact cameras were
        included from 1991.

        Rolleiflex medium format cameras continued to be produced by DHW
        Fototechnik up to 2014—a company founded by former Franke & Heidecke
        employees.DHW Fototechnik announced two new Rolleiflex cameras and a new
        electronic shutter for photokina 2012.The company filed for insolvency
        in 2014 and was dissolved in April 2015, ending any further production.
        The factory production equipment and remaining stocks of parts were
        auctioned off in late April 2015. A smaller company was created again
        with former DHW Fototechnik employees, under the name DW Photo at the
        same location.DW Photo focuses on producing the Rolleiflex Hy6 mod2
        medium format SLR camera (digital & film), servicing existing cameras,
        including providing firmware and hardware upgrades.
